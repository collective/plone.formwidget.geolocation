This package provides a z3c.form field and a widget implementing LeafletJS
from `pat-leaflet` to define Latitude / Longitude information.

This package is used as a dependency in some other Plone add-ons, like
`collective.geolocationbehavior <https://github.com/collective/collective.geolocationbehavior>`_
but can also be used directly in your own content type schema::

    from plone.formwidget.geolocation import GeolocationField

    ...

    geolocation = GeolocationField(
        title="Geolocation",
        description="Select the location of this content",
    )

The map marker has a popup containing object title / description (by default).
The template and/or the class used to generate the popup content can be overridden
to change it (see ``@@geolocation-geojson-popup`` view).
